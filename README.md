Step by Step process on creating environments in Anaconda Navigator in Windows

It is always preferred to create one environment before starting on your ML or Data Science project, but usually it is done in Linux. I'll show you how to do it in Windows using 
Anaconda Navigator (you can also do the same in Linux by going to your anaconda3 directory and running anaconda-navigator command in Terminal).

Step-1: Open Anaconda Navigator by giving administrator priviledges, by right-clicking on the icon and selecting Run as administrator, and then clicking Yes in the security warning dialog box that follows.

Step-2: Click on Environments from the side menu in Anaconda Navigator

Step-3: In the Environment list, select Create in the bottom tab.

Step-4: In the Name section give the name of your environment and in the Packages section select Python and from the drop-down menu select the Python version (it is notable to say
        if you want to work on notebook with Python 2.x then this is the way to do). If you want to work in a R project then select R. Usually both are not needed at the same             time.
        
Step-5: Now select your environment from the environment list and click on the arrow beside it. Select Open Terminal from the menu.

Step-6: Import the packages you want to work with in your project (usually by using pip, you can find yours in https://pypi.org/)

Step-7: Go to the Home menu from the sidepane and install the required applications required. 

That's all folks!!! It's all about making things simple!!!
